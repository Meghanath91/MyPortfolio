        "I am a Full Stack Web Developer with a strong interest in projects
        requiring conceptual and analytical thinking. I enjoy designing and
        developing websites with end users in mind. After working in
        telecommunications industry for three years I realized that my true
        passion underlies in creativity. So I wanted to combine my experience in
        technology and passion in creativity and start something new. I started
        learning web development. When I got the right time to switch career I
        joined in a coding boot camp, which gave me confidence and experience to
        present my self as Full stack developer. I don't like to define myself
        by the work I've done. I define myself by the work I want to do. Skills
        can be taught but attitude is inherent . I am a multi-talented person
        with knowledge and experience in different fields especially in
        telecommunications, networking. I prefer to keep learning, continue
        challenging myself, and do interesting things that matter. Moreover I am
        a professional photographer and graphic designer, so I wanted to combine
        these experiences together and create multidimensional experiences for
        users."
